The target access to a certain IP adress is denied. If the target website is hosted in a sharing website sever, all webssites on the same server will be blocked.This affects all IP protocalls (mostly TPC) such as HTTP, FTP, POP. A typical circumvention method is to find proxies that have accses to the target websites, but proxies may be jammed or blocked. Some websites allocated additional IP adresses to circumvent the block, but later the block was exteneded to cover the new adress.
